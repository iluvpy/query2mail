# Bash Email Crawling

Very simple bash script to crawl email addresses from a specific website.


## Disclamer

You CANNOT use it against any laws and TOS of the available online services.

This script is just here as a study example to show how to make a bash scrapper, but YOU are fully responsible of the usage of it and YOU CANNOT use it illegally or for spamming users. The script and myself (the present author) cannot in any case be responsible of the usage you make with it.
